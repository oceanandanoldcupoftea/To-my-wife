  <h2>
    <i> I love you </i>
  </h2>
  <p>That's it. I wanted to begin this by reminding you that I love you. There isn't a word stronger than affection that I could think of that could convey it as much as those three words. </p>  
  <br>
  <p>This year, we have been too busy and I don't know how we managed to survive that but we did so here's for you! For making it! I'm so proud of you for how you handled it all. I know it has been a very long and tiring road but you have done so well that I hope you don't feel burdened by it.</p>
  <br> 
  <p> Now you might be wondering what this is. Well I have started to learn HTML <del>(out of spite)</del> So here's what this is for</p>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li> For the next few months, this will be updated with new things. Little things I'd say relate or is about you. When would it be updated, well that would be a surprise</li>
    <li> Silly games! With even sillier prices!! (again, surprisessss)</li>
    <li> I can't really go through the screen to be next to you but I can make something (cook something) to keep you company </li>
  </ul>
  <p> SO anywayyyy Are you ready? Let's start with the usual, shall we?</p>
  <a>
